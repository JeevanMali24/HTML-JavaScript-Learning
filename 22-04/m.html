            <h2>History of Bhopal disaster</h2>
            <p>The Bhopal disaster, also referred to as the Bhopal gas tragedy, was a gas leak accident on the night of
                <mark> 2â€“3 December 1984 at the Union Carbide India Limited (UCIL) pesticide plant </mark>in Bhopal,
                Madhya Pradesh,
                India. The industrial disaster is considered the world's worst in history.[1] Over 500,000 people were
                exposed to methyl isocyanate (MIC) gas. The highly toxic substance made its way into and around the
                small towns located near the plant.[2] Estimates vary on the death toll. The official immediate death
                toll was 2,259. In 2008, the Government of Madhya Pradesh had paid compensation to the family members of
                3,787 victims killed in the gas release, and to 574,366 injured victims.[3] A government affidavit in
                2006 stated that the leak caused 558,125 injuries, including 38,478 temporary partial injuries and
                approximately 3,900 severely and permanently disabling injuries.[4] Others estimate that 8,000 died
                within two weeks, and another 8,000 or more have since died from gas-related diseases.

                Union Carbide India Limited (UCIL)<br>
                <br>
                In 1970, in the North adjacent to the slums and railway station, a pesticide plant was set up by Union
                Carbide India Limited (UCIL). From late 1977, the plant started manufacturing Sevin (Carbaryl) by
                importing primary raw materials, viz. alpha-naphtol and methyl isocyanate (MIC) in stainless steel drums
                from the Union Carbide's MIC plant in USA. However, from early 1980, the Bhopal plant itself started
                manufacturing MIC using the know-how and basic designs supplied by Union Carbide Corporation, USA (UCC).
                The Bhopal UCIL facility housed three underground 68,000 liters liquid MIC storage tanks: E610, E611,
                and E619 and were claimed to ensure all safety from leakage.
