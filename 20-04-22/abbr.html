            <h3>HTML</h3>
            <article>
                <p>The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be
                    displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
                    and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>
                <h3>Development</h3>
                <p>In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system
                    for CERN researchers to use and share documents.</p>
                <h3>Markup</h3>
                <p>HTML markup consists of several key components, including those called tags (and their attributes),
                    character-based data types, character references and entity references. HTML tags most commonly come
                    in pairs like and, although some represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example . The
                    first tag in such a pair is the start tag, and the second is the end tag.
